This Repo contains a python script to simulate a ball bouncing around elastically in a self defined environment. It also handles accuracy, simulation speed and animation of the resulting behavior.

In the Ball script (simply titled 'physics') Euler Discretization of Newtons Fundamental Theorem is used for computation. The Pendulum uses Lagrangian Dynamics and a more sophisticated Integrator with RK4.
