This Repo contains a python script to simulate a ball bouncing around elastically in a self defined environment. It also handles accuracy, simulation speed and animation of the resulting behavior.

For Computation, Euler Discretization of Newtons Fundamental Theorem is used. There is a stark possibility that I'll add Lagrangian Pendulums later, using the same Framework. Be sure to play around with this!
